Alignment of Reads to the Human Reference Genome
For the alignment of ChIP-seq reads to the human reference genome, we utilized 
Bowtie2 version 2.5.3 with default parameters. The trimmed FASTQ files were 
aligned to the Bowtie2 index generated in the previous week's analysis. The 
output of Bowtie2, in SAM format, was piped directly to samtools version 1.19.2 
for conversion to the more efficient BAM format. This approach not only conserves 
disk space but also allows for easier handling of the alignment files.

Sorting and Indexing Alignment Files
Following alignment, we sorted and indexed the aligned BAM files using samtools 
version 1.19.2. Sorting the BAM files is crucial for downstream applications, as 
it allows for faster access to specific genomic regions. The sorting was performed 
based on genomic coordinates, and subsequently, BAM indices (.bai files) were 
generated to facilitate rapid retrieval of alignments from the sorted BAM files.

Quality Control Assessment
Quality control assessment was conducted using samtools flagstat version 1.19.2, 
which provides summary statistics on various aspects of the alignment. This 
includes metrics such as the number of mapped reads, properly paired reads, and 
duplicates. The flagstat analysis was performed individually for each aligned 
sample, providing insight into the quality and characteristics of the alignments.

Aggregation of Quality Control Outputs with MultiQC
To aggregate the outputs from different quality control utilities and facilitate 
easy visualization and comparison, we employed MultiQC version 1.20. This tool 
generates a comprehensive HTML report summarizing the results from various QC 
tools used in the analysis. By compiling information from multiple sources into 
a single report, MultiQC simplifies the assessment of data quality and helps in 
identifying potential issues or discrepancies across samples.

Generation of BigWig Files and Correlation Analysis
For downstream analysis and visualization of ChIP-seq data, we converted the 
sorted BAM files to bigWig format using the bamCoverage utility from deeptools 
version 3.5.4. This process involves dividing the genome into equally sized bins 
and counting the number of alignments falling into each region. The resulting 
bigWig files enable visualization of signal intensity across the genome, allowing 
for the identification of regions enriched with ChIP-seq signal.

Finally, to compare the similarity between samples based on their ChIP-seq signal 
profiles, we performed correlation analysis using deeptools version 3.5.4. This 
involved calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between the signal profiles 
of different samples and visualizing the results as a clustered heatmap. This 
analysis helps assess the reproducibility of ChIP-seq experiments and provides 
insights into the consistency of binding patterns across experimental conditions 
and replicates.
